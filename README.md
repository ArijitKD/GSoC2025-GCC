## Project Background
The GCC compiler supports a wide range of processor architectures for generating the corresponding binaries. This is not just limited to conventional CPUs, but also accelerator devices such as _Graphical Processing Units_ (GPUs), better known as graphics cards. GPUs have their own machine code which the GCC compiler, built specifically for that purpose, is capable of generating.

Through a process called _Offloading_, it is possible to run a conventional GCC-compiled code on accelerator devices such as GPUs either partially or wholly.

## Project Background
The GCC compiler supports a wide range of processor architectures for generating the corresponding binaries. This is not just limited to conventional CPUs, but also accelerator devices such as _Graphical Processing Units_ (GPUs), better known as graphics cards. The GCC compiler, built specifically for a given GPU architecture, is capable of generating an intermediate machine code which get Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled by the underlying GPU vendor-specific toolchains. Through a process called _Offloading_, it is possible to run a conventional GCC-compiled code on accelerator devices such as GPUs. The _OpenMP/OpenACC_ APIs implemented in GCC provide a backend for this purpose.

For GCC compilers with offloading support, the Newlib C library is used as the standard library when compiling code with offloading enabled. Newlib provides syscall stubs that need to be implemented for specific architectures. For running OpenMP/OpenACC offloading tests that require performing a file operation, syscalls such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, etc. need to be implemented. These syscalls would internally interface with a filesystem that would be running entirely in the GPU's own memory (the VRAM).


## Aim of the Project
This project aims to enable OpenMP/OpenACC file I/O-based offloading tests to run successfully on NVIDIA GPUs. This specifically requires modifying the stub syscalls in Newlib's NVPTX backend, which is the one used for NVIDIA GPUs.

The project is divided into two main parts:
- Develop an in-memory filesystem that runs entirely in the GPU's memory;
- Modify the file I/O-based stub syscalls to  interface with this filesystem.


## Design and Implementation

### The Filesystem
The filesystem is very simple by design. It is a statically allocated buffer (called `vramfs`) made up of individual units, singularly called an **Entry**. An **Entry** is a data structure which stores a file's name, size and data. It looks like this:
```
struct Entry {
    char name[MAX_FNAME];
    size_t size;
    char *data;
}
```
Each Entry in `vramfs` is initialized to `{.name = "", .size = 0, .data = NULL}` which represents an empty slot. Additionally, a special entry `{.name = "/dev/null", .size = 0, .data = NULL}` has been implemented to simulate the null device on POSIX systems. 

A second statically allocated buffer (called `open_files`) keeps track of all the files that are currently open. In the context of this filesystem, a **File** is a data structure which holds information about the current read/write offset in an Entry's data, the opening mode, and a reference to the Entry that is being operated upon. It looks like this:
```
struct File {
    size_t offset;
    int mode;
    struct Entry *entref;
}
```
Each File in `open_files` is initialized to `{.offset = 0, .mode = -1, .entref = NULL}`, representing an empty slot. The index of a non-empty slot in `open_files` gives the file descriptor associated with the corresponding File. File descriptors 0, 1, 2 associate are associated with STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR as per requirements and pre-initialized accordingly. As such, only file descriptors 3 or higher (upto `MAX_FOPEN - 1`) are available for use.

### Syscalls
As of **15 September 2025**, the following syscalls have been implemented:
- `open()`
- `read()`
- `write()`
- `close()`
These are located in the source files under `<newlib-repo-root>/newlib/libc/machine/nvptx`, especially in `misc.c`.

### Supported file open modes
Only a few file open modes have been implemented, keeping in mind the simple usage that the file system is intended for. These are:
- `MODE_R` = `O_RDONLY`, equivalent to the `"r"` mode
- `MODE_W` = `(O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC)`, equivalent to the `"w"` mode
- `MODE_A` = `(O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND)`, equivalent to the `"a"` mode
- `MODE_R_PLUS` = `O_RDWR`, equivalent to the `"r+"` mode
- `MODE_W_PLUS` = `(O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC)`, equivalent to the `"w+"` mode
- `MODE_A_PLUS` = `(O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_APPEND)`, equivalent to the `"a+"` mode
- `MODE_RW_TRUNC` = `(O_RDWR | O_TRUNC)`, special mode for handling STDIO files
